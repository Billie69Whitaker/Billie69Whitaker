## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a junior backend developer currently focused on understanding and implementing authentication and authorization patterns. This repository is a collection of hands-on projects and practice exercises that explore how to securely manage user access in modern web applications.

Authentication and authorization are core aspects of backend development, and Iâ€™m learning how to handle them using different strategiesâ€”such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), sessions, OAuth2, and role-based access control (RBAC). My goal is to build secure, scalable systems that protect user data while providing smooth and reliable user experiences.

In these projects, Iâ€™m working with tools and frameworks that support authentication flows, including password hashing, token management, refresh logic, and access control for APIs. Iâ€™m also practicing how to structure backend logic to separate concerns like user management, middleware for route protection, and permission checks.

This repository includes sample projects like user login systems, protected API routes, email verification flows, and admin dashboards. Each one is designed to help reinforce the core concepts of secure user management while staying maintainable and easy to understand.

As I grow, Iâ€™m also exploring common security practices such as rate limiting, encryption, secure cookie handling, and preventing vulnerabilities like token leakage or session fixation. I aim to follow best practices and write clean, well-commented code that others can learn from, too.

If youâ€™re also learning about backend security or working on authentication systems, feel free to browse the code, ask questions, or share ideas. Iâ€™m always eager to improve and collaborate with others working through similar topics.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building safer, smarter backends, one login at a time.
